Various tools & docs regarding MAME emulation
=============================================

This repository is meant to be a place where I will publish various accessory tools & documents about MAME emulation.
They mostly have something to do with the emulators I wrote. At the moment they are:

- Intel Intellec MDS-II (`imds2`)
- HP 64000 (`hp64k`)
- HP 9845 (`hp9845b`, `hp9845c`, `hp9845t`)
- HP 85A (`hp85`)
- HP 2645A (`hp2645`)
